# MLogger
A basic interface for logging in C++.
MLogger is made entirely out of static methods within the actual `MLogger` class, so the user does not have to worry about using macros or anything of that sort.

## Requirements:
C++11

## Examples:
An example of the basic functions of MLogger can be found in `test.cpp`.
